Some code & resources for interfacing with the RDM6300 RFID reader. Anything written by me can be used under the Apache-2.0 license.

- `reader.py`: connects to the module over serial and prints a line for each detected badge. See `--help` for options.
- `rdm6300-schematic.pdf`: a rough schematic of the module I found. Very helpful when trying to understand how the module works and how to do it yourself.
